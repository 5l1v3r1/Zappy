# Simple ZAP scanner in Python3
This scanner uses the official ZAP API to communicate with the local tool and perform scans.
The tool consists of one singe class, representing the scanner module. The current features in this class are:

- Perform directory crawl
- Perform fill active scan (attack)

The `__main__()` function is just a basic usage example.
